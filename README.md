# Bug Tracking Application 🐛

This Bug Tracker app is created with MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS) stack. A bug tracking system ensures bugs are detected and fixed. It helps get rid of issues in the software by regulating the work of each team member, which is crucial if you're running large projects.

## Things you can do with the app: ⚙
1. You can create an account using two options: Manual login or use your _Google account_ to quickly login.
2. You can create a Bug by clicking the "Create Bug" button in the main dashboard.
3. View bugs created by other members
4. Edit/Delete your post.
5. Logout

You can check the deployed site here 🚀:

### You can also check the project's backend repository, [here](https://github.com/davebanguilan/Project_Website_BugTracker_BE).

_*Note:* I'm still working for the mobile responsiveness of the site and other features._
